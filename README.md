# MultiGameHack
Since Blinks don't yet transfer their games to each other, this sketch provides a method to have many games on every Blink and then a special cue tells the Blinks to all change to the next game. This is the best way to bring games (plural) to game night.

Note: this is what I am currently carrying on my Blinks, a good way to bring them to game nights. You can see how you can simply replace any of these games with one of your own. The current restriction is that "5 consecutive clicks" is the special handshake to switch to the next game at the moment... so if you game uses a 5 click move... perhaps rethink it :)

## Games
1. BeRrY (designed by ViVi and Vanilla)
2. Bomb Brigade (designed by Jeff Kowalski, Holly Gore, and Colin Gallo
3. Mortals (designed by Nick Bentley and Jonathan Bobrow)
4. Fracture (designed by Celia Pearce, Mike Lazer-Walker, Jonathan Bobrow et. al)
5. Speed Racer (a snake like game that I am toying around with... designed by Jonathan Bobrow)

## How To Use
1. Place all Blinks together
2. Click a single Blink 5 times (relatively quickly)
3. Watch all of the connected Blinks update to start playing the next game
Note: when the game is changed, it is as if the previous game is paused, you can see this clearly when changing from Mortals

The versions of the games here might have some deviation from the games master repos. I should be cleaner about this in the future, making sure all versions of games are simply branches in their specific repos.
