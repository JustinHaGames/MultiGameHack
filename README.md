# MultiGameHack
Since Blinks don't yet transfer their games to each other, this sketch provides a method to have many games on every Blink and then a special cue tells the Blinks to all change to the next game. This is the best way to bring games (plural) to game night.

Note: this is what I am currently carrying on my Blinks, a good way to bring them to game nights. You can see how you can simply replace any of these games with one of your own. The current restriction is that "5 consecutive clicks" is the special handshake to switch to the next game at the moment... so if you game uses a 5 click move... perhaps rethink it :)
